# Infant sleep as a topic in healthcare guidance of parents, prenatally and the first 6 months after birth: a scoping review

# Inger Pauline Landsem1,2* and Nina Bøhle Cheetham1

# Abstract

Background: This scoping review focuses on infant sleep-related factors and themes that are relevant when health practitioners provide preventive health services to expectant and new parents.

Methods: A systematic literature search in CINAHL, PubMed, and PsycINFO, published in 2010 or later, identified 1661 records. The search was further narrowed to focus on sleep in healthy term-born infants until the second half of the first year of life. A blinded review by both authors covered 136 papers, of which 43 papers were reviewed in the full text. Finally, 38 articles were included in the data extraction.

Results: The analysis process showed that the selected studies formed three main information categories: 11 studies thematised safe infant sleep issues, 10 studies described design and findings from sleep-related intervention studies, and 17 studies focused on different parent-child interactive aspects that may influence the quality and duration of infant sleep in the first six months of life. The main finding is that knowledge about early infant sleep is very complex, and includes both child, parent, and environmental factors. Several studies have shown that the concepts and factors related to safe infant sleep also influence the development of healthy infant sleep patterns. Thus, these aspects are interwoven with each other and should be addressed together in communication with parents.

Conclusions: Health practitioners with different professional backgrounds need to search for an agreement on when and how different aspects of sleep-related knowledge should be communicated to new and expectant parents to enable the design of national follow-up programs. Parents want coherent and personalized services regarding infant sleep issues that may allow them to choose sleeping arrangements, routines, and behaviors that fit in with their sociocultural attitudes and traditions. Many different sources and formats may be used to empower parents regarding infant sleep issues. Studies have described the use of group or individual meetings, videos, and written materials. The key issue is the importance of consistent and seamless knowledge-based services.

# Keywords:

Infant sleep, Sleep safety, Place of sleep, Parental guidance, Sleep consolidation, Bedtime routines

# Background

Establishing nighttime-sleep (NTS) in early infancy is challenging for many parents. Both professionals and parents have summarized these difficulties in recent Norwegian publications [1–3] and research has documented that many parents struggle to follow advices on safe infant sleep, despite regular campaigns to promote such.

information [4]. The importance of suﬃcient sleep is well known, and updated recommendations on sleep duration for groups of children aged five years or less were published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019 [5]. Short sleep duration or interrupted sleep in infancy is associated with increased sleeping diﬃculties later in childhood [6], as well as risks of a range of health problems [7, 8]. Infant sleep is a complex phenomenon associated with factors as parental sleep and mental health [9], maternal sensitivity [10] and parental practices [11].

Most healthcare professionals know that the first six months of infancy are characterized by maturation and sleep consolidation [12, 13]. The term “sleep problems” is rarely used until the infant enters the second half of the first year [1]. Research has identified this early consolidation phase as important for determining whether sleep-related problems occur later in infancy or toddlerhood [14, 15].

Parent facilitation of infant sleep is thought to be influenced by the baby’s and parents’ and caretakers’ personalities, family context, economy, general environment, and cultural traditions [16]. Research emphasizes the importance of a good alliance with healthcare professionals when establishing safe and development-promoting sleep [17]. Although there is a large volume of research related to infant sleep safety, duration, and sleep hygiene, there is a lack of research exploring how health professionals can strengthen parents’ experience of self-efficacy, and how this relates to the way sleep-related advice is communicated. We find few publications from North European countries other than the United Kingdom (UK). Northern Europe is characterized by rapid demographic changes, as in most of the world [18]. Because of education or work, young people frequently move away from their families. This may weaken their social neurobiological approach that addresses what is thought to be natural for human beings [23, 24]. Advice and counseling must be relevant for parents and conveyed in a sensitive and understandable way, taking into consideration cultural differences [25]. There seems to be a lack of studies addressing which topics of sleep advice should be addressed and when. When screening publications over the last 20 years, we detected interventions initiated during pregnancy [26], maternity wards [27], and postnatal care [28, 29]. Research shows some inconsistencies in advice and the factors that influence parents' adherence to safe sleep guidelines, and many parents do not use safe sleep practices at home [30, 31]. Preventive communication about infant sleep includes many topics, and short interventions seem to have the best effect on parental adjustments to infants’ sleep [32, 33].

It is important to understand what healthcare professionals who meet expecting and new parents through pregnancy, childbirth, and postnatal care follow-ups should consider when providing support and information. Altogether, these services aim to promote both safe and developmentally preferable sleep in infants and healthy role transitions for mothers, partners, and families [34, 35]. These topics are addressed in this review in an attempt to provide an overview of different aspects that may be included in coherent, seamless services for new families. The topics addressed are also consistent with health-related goals launched by the Department of Health and Care, UK [36]. The research question guiding the review is as follows: “Which factors are described as important in health personnel’s guidance of expectant and new parents when the goal is safe and well-consolidated infant sleep?

# Method and material

networks in the phase of life in which they become parents. Living conditions, sometimes in small apartments, may provide limited opportunities for safe infant sleep. Northern Europe is a region with a colder climate and greater seasonal variations in light and temperature than Mediterranean and tropical zones. Seasonal light shifts and polar nights are known to affect sleep among adults [19]; however, little is known about the degree to which these factors affect infant sleep development and habits. Several Northern European countries are recognized as having some of the best health welfare systems in the world [20], but we have been unable to find information that links health system quality to follow-up systems for infants and new families.

Existing safe infant sleep advice seems to be based on at least two strong paradigms [21, 22]: the risk-elimination approach advocated by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and a risk-reducing, cultural, and neurobiological approach that addresses what is thought to be natural for human beings [23, 24]. The methodology is reframed in recent years by a research team affiliated to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) [38–40]. The original methodological steps focused on defining a research question, systematic searches followed by reasoned selection of studies, summarization and report of the results [37]. The updated framework emphasizes that an analysis of the findings is made and that this is an essential part of further presentation of results. In line with the JBI recommendations a research protocol has been formed and published on Open Science Framework (OSF) [41]. This study deals

with interactions between different groups of individuals, as displayed in the search strategy (Table study focuses on sleep concepts and factors described as important for health professionals to address in dialogues about infant sleep, both prenatally and after birth. These contexts, where parent-infant dyads meet with health practitioners, might vary somewhat depending on the health service organization in different countries. This review focuses on regular health-promoting follow-up services for new or expecting parents without known illnesses or risks. Infant sleep information and guidance may be taken care of by different groups of professionals in pregnancy (by midwives or general practitioners [GP] physicians), maternity wards (by midwives, nursery nurses, or pediatricians), or during infancy (by midwives, health nurses, GP physicians, or other services). In this paper, they are all named health practitioners, and guidance may be given as instructions, information, discussions, etc. This review is not designed to recommend any form of guidance; thus, we address this as a communicative interaction.

Infant sleep outcomes may be bidirectionally influenced by parental mental health and nutritional arrangements during infancy [42, 43]. The authors recognize the importance of these factors, but choose to focus solely on infant sleep outcomes. Table 2 summarizes the criteria that guided systematic searches of the PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO, databases. Table 1 shows the search strategy used.

This review focuses on infant sleep and parental advice in countries characterized by a subarctic or continental climate, corresponding to European countries north of the Alps. However, we considered research from all the geographic regions. Additional searches have been conducted using terms as “seasonal, season, polar nights, cold climate” in combination with infant sleep. This iterative search process is in line with updated methodological advices [39]. The included databases enabled us to detect publications in the most relevant fields of research, such as nursing, midwifery, child health, medicine, and psychology. Owing to the large number of papers addressing infant sleep in this multidisciplinary field, no publications older than 2010 were considered. This limitation also seemed appropriate because previous research is largely included in later reviews. An overview of the data-selection process is presented in Fig. 1.

# Results

Tables 3, 4, and 5 present 38 selected articles. Information about the first author, country, year of publication, aims and participants, main results, key factors, and possible implications are listed as requested [45]. More than

- The included studies shaped three main categories of information that answered our research question.
- Table 3 presents 11 studies on infant sleep safety (7 original studies and 4 reviews).
- Table 4 presents nine studies describing complex or specific infant sleep interventions, relevant until infants age of 6 months (five original studies and four reviews).
- Table 5 presents 17 studies exploring factors that may have an impact on infant sleep quality and duration until 6 months of age (16 original studies and 1 review).

Quality assessment of the included studies is not obligatory when conducting a scoping review. However, the detection of recently published high-quality papers has become a priority in the selection process because several important sleep-related factors have been investigated in many original papers and reviews over the last 10 years. The factors suggested for incorporation into health practitioners’ communicative interactions with new parents are listed in Fig. 2. Unfortunately, additional searches focusing on sleep and climatic factors, such as polar nights and seasonal lightning, did not identify studies that qualified for inclusion in this review.

# Discussion

This study investigated which factors are described as important in health practitioners’ communicative interactions with new and expectant parents on infants’ sleep safety and development. We recognize that topics related

# Comments and clinical implications

Different sleep-arrangements influence (a) avoiding smoke, alcohol, and drugs, infants sensory and physical micro-minutes long video focused on “My grandma says - family traditions”.

Healthcare workers should be context sensitive and personalize their information about safe infant sleep. The authors state that programs like the BBB should be evaluated on a periodic basis to assure that they positively influence parental knowledge and practices about safe infant sleep. The program focused on sleep position, use of pacifiers, and the ABCs of safe sleeping: alone, on the back and in a crib.

Bed-sharing was associated with lower cortisol response to a mild stressor (bath) at five weeks but was also associated with slightly higher axillary and skin-temperature and more frequent breastfeeding. The study did not control for changes in sleep knowledge among health workers in the unit.

# Results

Sleep duration was reported in 19 studies. Compared to solitary sleep, bed-sharing was associated with significantly shorter sleep among infants in six studies, no difference in four, and longer sleep duration in two studies. Analysis resulted in 14 findings that assessed in 27 papers and subjective data in 32 papers.

# Methods

A systematic review and meta synthesis were conducted to evaluate a program in a high-risk US area. Data collection was by surveys developed for this study. The review included 40 papers reporting on infants aged six months or younger. Among 100 studies, 24 were selected for intensive review and 14 studies included.

# Aims & participants

Assess the usefulness of an educational video about infant safe sleep that was tested by 43 new mothers, while 49 new mothers received standard care. The study aimed to identify teaching strategies that nurses can use to increase families' safe sleep practices before and after implementation of an educational program and free crib distribution.

# Comments and clinical implications

The intervention included information on safe sleep positions, absence of objects in sleep environment, introduction of pacifier for sleep once breastfeeding is established and room-sharing. Results indicate that intentional bed-sharing parents were more likely to endorse and be satisfied with bed-sharing, while mothers that mostly were unmarried reported more satisfaction with bed-sharing.

Some studies focus on the difference between intentional and reactive bed-sharing. The study focuses on a group of US mothers with varying socio-economic resources (SES). The parents of reactive bed-sharers had lower SES. Mothers who reported receiving information in the enhanced information group used less soft bedding last night (adj 0.013, used less soft bedding in the last week (adj 0.006). More African countries are investigated and nuanced.

The relation between P-CBS and risks of sudden infant death is explored across different disciplines introducing a new term “psychoanthropediatrics”. Additionally, 93% of infants were observed in a safe sleep environment (a 24 and 33% increase over baselines). These rates raised from 72 to 95% of the time (a 24–57% increase over the baseline). Maternal self-efficacy was associated with more frequent inappropriate arrangements.

# Results

A knowledge-campaign lasting for a median of 160 days (range, 101–273) was implemented in 8 US-maternity wards, aiming to improve health professionals’ knowledge and role modeling about infant safe sleep. A randomized controlled study (RCT) was conducted where new mothers answered a survey before discharge from hospital. All data are based on self-reports.

# Aims & participants

Can enhanced information reduce the use of soft bedding?

ence parental behavior at home. In the included studies some mothers were helping them understand AAP recommendations for safe sleep. The images to which parents are exposed send mixed messages. Health care professionals should portray safe sleep for infants in media, marketing materials, and other advice on sleep position and 40.2% on sleep location.

The only informational item that parents reported receiving a health workers at follow-up compared to the post-test survey was that use of a pacifier decreases the risk of SUID.

# Safe infant sleep education and role

The choices nurses make regarding safe infant sleep practices can influence knowledge and compliance with safe sleep recommendations. Participants described three consistent factors that influenced how newborns sleep at home. The most frequently reported sources of information were from books, pictures, television, and the Internet.

Participants reported increased knowledge after the program: at pre-test, 58.4% of participants were aware of the AAP safe sleep recommendations, which increased to 96.2% at post-test.

# Comments and clinical implications

Safe infant sleep and parental resources are introduced as resources that may strengthen health workers ability to be context sensitive and personalize their information in communication with new parents about infant sleep safety.

Based on the study information, six themes of underlying reasons why caregivers might not practice safe sleep behaviors were identified and included: (a) culture and family tradition; (b) knowledge about safe sleep practices; (c) resource access; (d) stressed out parents; (e) lack of support; and (f) fear for safety of baby.

# Comments and clinical implications

It is a great heterogeneity between the focus on the high variability in neurodevelopmental interventions that is best. Efficacy depends on the first six months. Unsettled infant results from this study differ compared in line with previous Cochrane review [57]. They can’t conclude what types of interventions, routines, use of diaries: focal feed, minimized interactions on night, differentiate.

Provision of parental education differed. Parental competence or confidence was related to developmental stages and sleep maturation phenomenon. They argue for a holistic approach in attempts to support and empower parents including individualized approaches, cue-based care, and programs included in this study. Thus, the findings concur with Cochrane review in 2013 [57].

Key information given to parents on infants’ maturation and age.

The studies provide evidence that sleep interventions are inefficient for infants younger than 6 months. Main critiques are presented as 3 methodological difficulties: 1) to little differentiation of infants' first year and 3) that some studies interpret associations as causal.

The authors argue that behavioral interventions had a small positive effect on total night waking. Compared with controls, the RPI group were less likely to have prolonged bedtime routines at one year. They were more seldom fed to sleep and had longer nocturnal sleep duration. Interventions assessing infant crying did not show significant intervention effects compared to control groups.

# Comments and clinical implications

The authors question if antenatal education should be viewed as normal, due to the ongoing neurodevelopmental maturation associated with an increase in mothers’ engaging in behavioral extinction strategies, sleep promotive environments and higher degrees of maternal anxiety or depression, possibly associated with the intervention consisting of one individual session with a specially trained sleep consultant (pediatrician), supplemented with a leaflet. The information included knowledge about normal infant sleep for healthy development, sleep hygiene including routines, infant solitary sleep adaptation to the extrauterine world.

Teaching parents to understand and respond to infant cues, through the day and at the transition to sleep was possible without changes in response patterns. These effects were detected with linear mixed models (p < 0.001). The mean increase in total sleep time (TST) was 4.51; 95% CI, 1.69–12) and IG-infants were reported as more able to fall asleep alone and needed less feeding to sleep. The frequency of problematic sleep reported by all mothers was 16.1% at 6 months and 19.9% at 6 months.

# Main results

Parental practices related to infant safe sleep were not affected by the sleep education at 6 months. Infants in the IG group slept more often in their own bed at their age (OR adj = 5.8-hour per 24 hours; 95% CI, 2.3–7.4). At 4 months, IG-infants were less often fed to sleep than controls (OR adj = 1.49; 95% CI, 0.9–2.4).

# Methods

An experimental, longitudinal study with implementation of a 15-minutes educational session. Data was collected from sleep logs, questionnaires and saliva samples. Data based on parental self-report and actigraphy were from 4 to 11 months old.

# Aims & participants

Evaluates the preventive effects of a sleep intervention given antenatally. Investigating changes in infants' total sleep time (TST) in a prospective, clinical study. Families were enrolled in a maternity ward in comparison with a control group (CG). Total N = 802 families, 34 mother-infant dyads.

# Feedback given across this development

In managing their infants' sleep both antenatally and in infancy, adapted. This paper does not mention the importance of infant safe sleep; thus, we don’t know if it’s incorporated in the program. Results from this study may indicate that the intervention strengthened mothers’ capacity to handle these challenges.

# Comments and clinical implications

The process confirms that parents want knowledge about normal infant sleep. Infant sleep development follows individual tracks the first six months of life. SIG-mothers reported greater confidence, even though the relation was not tested.

# Parent behavior (swaddling); sleep quality

The authors conclude that swaddling may reduce the risk of infant injuries or death as sleep becomes more consolidated even when children sleep in the recommended supine position. Participating families were not identified with any sleep problems before study inclusion. Mean age of the children was months. The intervention did not affect any other maternal outcomes later in childhood. Most parents found swaddling as a safe practice. Parents who did not swaddle routinely were more likely to use inappropriate sleeping positions. Parents need to learn how to swaddle in a safe manner to avoid increased risks of injuries or sudden death.

# Bedtime routines

Bedtime routines were almost 9 (0.020), reduced the number of changes in sleep state. Preschoolers were associated with (0.013) and they were to put their infant in supine position.

This research is one part of a large comprehensive study that primarily focuses on factors involved in transactional relationships between infants and parents, relevant in relation to stress regulation and the importance of less emotional available mothers but also reported with longer sleep laps.

Findings shed light on factors involved in stress regulation. Cortisol decreased with age for infants. It is suggested that infant sleep regulation may benefit from appropriate night-time interventions in the first few months of life, while similar associations were not detected at six months.

# Key words and comments

Parenting behavior; physical health; sleep availability; sleep quality; bedtime routines; parental emotional availability; biobehavioral synchrony; obesity prevention.

# Main results

By 4 months: children sleeping in separate rooms had more regular night-waking. More of these episodes were associated with a steeper decline in infant cortisol levels. The number of distress-initiated night wakings was associated with a faster reduction of non-distressed episodes.

# Methods

This study investigates associations between parent-infant room sharing (cosleepers or not) and two different night-time parenting behaviors among parents. A randomized controlled trial collected data by use of video equipment in family homes, salvia sampling, and maternal self-report.

# Aims & participants

230 mother/infant dyads with healthy, term born infants at a US maternity ward were recruited. An investigation of associations between infants’ cortisol patterns at 3, 6, and 9 months was conducted.

# Factors to be considered in health practitioners’ communicative interactions with new or expectant parents

to parents’ health and their decisions regarding infant feeding are interwoven in the planning and nurturing of infant sleep. However, these factors are not discussed in this review. The following discussion is based on the three categories described in Tables 3, 4 and 5 and refers to many of the factors summarized in Fig. 2.

Studies regarding infant sleep safety

Table 3 includes 11 studies that investigated the effects of interventions promoting safe infant sleep in different educational programs. Seven studies described interventions based on the AAP guidelines which highlight the importance of back to sleep for infants, use of pacifiers in the first year, avoidance of soft sleeping surfaces, and items in infant beds that can increase the risk of SUID and warnings against parent-child bedsharing. Both short interventions, such as educational videos, and longer programs and campaigns have been described. Four studies have discussed earlier research findings on similar topics.

Although highlighted safe sleep recommendations seem to be widely known and recommended, research shows that parents tend to form their own practice in their home environments. This applies particularly to the sharing of the same bed surface. Parents are influenced by family, friends, and society, as well as advertising and the Internet, and they frequently practice bedsharing despite AAP-recommendations not to do so. In Europe, recommendations regarding parent-infant bedsharing (P-CBS) are articulated somewhat differently compared to those in the USA, depending on national policies.

Parents’ capacity to receive information in the perinatal period is described as limited; thus, how information about and modeling safe sleep issues are personalized and given is important. Health practitioners’ teaching strategies must be tailored to fit each individual family for success. Several studies have emphasized the importance of updated knowledge not associated with an increased occurrence of SUID.

# Development and evaluation of interventions addressing infant sleep consolidation

Six studies, published in the last 5 years, describe infant sleep-related interventions with high relevance for the early postnatal period [26–28, 56, 58, 59]. In addition, four reviews summarize earlier studies and discuss the degree to which sleep-related interventions may increase sleep outcomes in the postnatal period of life [29, 53–55]. One intervention was started antenatally, two were implemented in maternity wards, and three were designed to support families at postnatal follow-up meetings.

Different theoretical frameworks appear to inform the design of the interventions and studies included. Several interventions aim to teach parents about infant sleep and how they can promote early consolidation of sleep habits in their infants [27, 56, 58, 59]. Ball et al. (2020) introduced an alternative approach focusing on parents’ need for knowledge about normal sleep development, homeostatic sleep pressure, healthy activities when awake, the importance of cued-based care, and that advice should be adapted to each family and their cultural preferences [28].

This review will not explore the gaps between different approaches, but some gaps seem important and may reflect the different conclusions reported in the reviews included [29, 53, 55]. A review from 2013 concluded that behavioral sleep interventions during the first six months of life do not have significant effects on infant sleep [53], while later reviews reported several positive effects [29, 54, 55]. Some studies found that early interventions may increase infants’ night-time sleep [26, 54], reduce the frequency of nightwakings [71], increase the use of recommended early bedtimes for infants [56], prevent prolonged bedtime routines, eat as the last activity before sleep [27, 56], and help infants to sleep more regularly in their own cot [27]. No intervention reported effects related to the duration or frequency of infant crying. This concurs with a previous suggestion that infant crying in the first months of life depends on the maturation and biology of each individual child [57].

When parents are offered understandable and knowledge-based advice, it may be easier for health practitioners to establish trustworthy relationships with new families. When respectful alliances are formed, parents may be more likely to find advice and recommendations relevant to them [35]. Our review shows that guidance and recommendations can be promoted through different approaches, which should be consistent and knowledge-based.

# Studies investigating aspects associated with infant sleep quality

The final group of studies consisted of 16 original studies and one review addressing different sleep-related factors (Table 5). All studies focused on aspects of the parent-infant interactive context related to sleep quality (consolidation) or infant sleep duration (Fig. 2). Parent behavior related to bedtime routines and/or night-time behavior has been addressed in six studies [14, 60, 69, 70, 73, 74]; two studies focused on the benefits of regular.

babymassage [61,  65] and two on the benefits of regular swaddling [68, 71]. One US study reported results related to parent-infant sleep and room sharing [72], one Turkish study reported significant improvements in infant sleep after teaching parents different soothing techniques [75], and two studies reported somewhat contrasting findings related to associations between infants’ daytime screen-viewing and infant sleep [64, 66]. One study report findings related to the impact of parents’ emotional availability in interactions with their child prior to sleep [69], while another report that parents use of “cry it out” strategies is not associated with negative outcomes at children’s age of 18 months, even when this strategy has been used across the first month of life [62]. One study addressed the importance of varying the direction of the infant’s head when initiating sleep because the skull of a newborn baby is soft, thus increasing the risk of cranial asymmetry [67]. Parents need appropriate information about this, and an education program designed for nurses has been reported with promising results [67]. Advice on the use of the correct type of pillow may conflict with safe sleep recommendations. Lastly, an Italian study confirmed previous findings of much more variation in infants’ sleep consolidation in the first versus second half of the first year [63].

The studies mentioned above were selected because they tap different aspects highlighted in the transactional model of infant sleep [8, 16]. Thus, it is important to consider when health practitioners design communicative interaction programs for new parents. Many studies confirm the importance of consistent bedtime routines as early as possible during the postnatal period [14, 60, 65, 69, 70, 73]. The importance of consistent, multicomponent routines flexibly adapted to each child may not be obvious to new parents. Parents may need information about the advantage of putting a newborn to sleep drowsy but awake, or to be introduced to the use of baby-massage with lotion as a part of a routine, along with other elements fitting in with their traditions and values [47, 52]. Many parents need basic information about massage rather than touch and tender patting of the skin [15, 65, 69, 70]. The need for more knowledge may also apply to swaddling [68, 71].

The factors mentioned above may influence both safe sleep arrangements for infants and how parents can support the optimal development of regulative behavior and sleep consolidation in their child [31, 47, 71]. Thus, interventions for new or expectant parents and infants should combine communication about safe infant sleep and advice about how they can influence sleep consolidation in their child. This new paradigm was introduced by Mileva-Seitz and colleagues [21]. The holistic and cue-based intervention SBY, designed in the UK in close collaboration with many stakeholders, seems to be a good starting point [28]. Nevertheless, we could not identify any focus on infant safe sleep issues in the SBY program description. A recurrent theme across included studies is the importance of giving parents knowledge about newborn infants’ sleep behaviors and states, and that these patterns differ significantly from sleep in older infants and adults [26, 55, 58, 75]. A similar focus is prominent in the framework of newborn behavioral observation (NBO) [2, 35], where health practitioners are educated on how to help parents understand and adapt to their children’s sleep and other behaviors. NBO focuses on how to understand infant behaviors as meaningful expressions, helping parents adapt to them, and finding helpful parenting solutions. The NBO approach appears to be a powerful tool to consider when designing new sleep-related interventions. Even in the first months of life, when rhythms involving eating, sleeping, and social interactions are characterized by a lack of regularity, parents seem empowered when they discover their infants’ incipient competences [85].

Another recurrent theme is the importance of individualized and personalized guidance by parents on infant sleep issues, avoiding standard information packages [47, 52]. This is in line with a Scottish qualitative study of how new mothers want to be met and supported by health practitioners [86]. Mothers want to work in partnerships with professionals, obtain knowledge-based advice free of stigma, help establish realistic expectations, and encourage them to make their own choices based on their family’s needs [86]. This is almost a rewriting of the values promoted by NBO courses in Norway [35]. The famous words of the Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard, referred to as “the art of helping”, may be the best way to sum up this important theme: “If one is truly to succeed in leading a person to a specific place, one must first and foremost take care to find him where he is and begin there. This is the secret in the entire art of helping” [87].

One important reason why infant sleep becomes a challenge for new parents is short naps, night waking, and frequent infant crying behavior [88]. Several of the included studies dealt with crying behavior. High frequencies of infant crying have been reported in studies in many different countries and cultures, even though the amount of crying has been reported to be significantly different between nations [89]. Crying behavior is closely related to conditions in an individual infant, and systematic reviews have failed to detect interventions that significantly reduce crying behavior [57]. While some describe strategies such as delayed response or letting the baby “cry it out” as possibly harmful [28] one study reports no long-term negative effects of “cry it out” in the first six months of life on childrens’ attachment quality [62].

and Teti reported that parents’ emotional availability may be more important than how they respond when settling an infant to sleep [73]. Another study reported that appropriate nighttime interventions in the first three months of life may support infant sleep consolidation. Non-distress-initiated interventions seem to disturb solitary sleepers differently compared to co-sleeping infants [74]. Different findings do not shape a clear picture, but several studies show that swaddling and soothing behaviors may reduce infant crying and fussiness [71, 75]. More research is needed to investigate whether or how different aspects of parental behavior influence infant sleep across the four quarters of the first year of life. A recent Finnish study documented that natural and artificial light have an impact on sleep architecture in 1 month old infants [90]. Climatic variations may also have an impact on infant sleep development; however, more research is needed to clarify the mechanisms involved.

# Strengths and limitations of this review

The main strength of this study is the thorough follow-up of methodological advice on scoping reviews given over the last 20 years [37–40, 45]. The scope of the study was limited to advice on healthy infant sleep in the first 6 months of life. However, the selection of studies uncovered a complex and manifold package of knowledge. The authors have strived to select studies that are of high quality, recently published, and tap different important aspects involved in the facilitation of early infant sleep. Thus, previously important contributions to this field of knowledge may not be mentioned in this review. Studies focusing on how somatic health problems such as colds, itchy skin, and eating challenges may interrupt infant sleep were excluded.

# Conclusions

This scoping review documents a wide range of factors and themes that may be relevant to early preventive communication with expectant and new parents. Factors related to safe infant sleep and healthy sleep development are interwoven. Health practitioners in regions with a common health policy should search for an agreement on how to combine these factors in communicative interactions with parents. Parents want coherent and personalized services regarding infant sleep issues, and health practitioners involved in follow-up services need to cooperate in the design of appropriate programs. Different sources of information can be used by different participants or technological platforms [91]. It seems important that professionals and stakeholders within each country come together to develop a common approach about when, what, and how to communicate important sleep-related knowledge to new families.
